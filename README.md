library(AnlysisOfWaves)

wave_or_EAP_threshold <- 10 # Set time for highlighting the relative wave occurrence.

df_waves_intact_cells %>%
  my_cum_occu_wave_plot_func(reffer_wave_thres = wave_or_EAP_threshold,
                             my_var = "Wave_latency",
                             base_size = 28, line_size = 2)
```

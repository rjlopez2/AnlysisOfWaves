\usage{
plot_residuals_func(
  model_nsdf,
  augmented_df = "augment",
  faceted_by_1 = "Condition  + Animal",
  faceted_by_2 = "."
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_nsdf}{A nested df containing a model object and previously processed with the \code{extract_model_info()} function.}

\item{augmented_df}{The column name containing the df with the fit vs residuals values of the model. By defoult this columns in named \code{"augment"}.}

\item{faceted_by_1}{A string. Grouping variables for visualization. Default to \code{Condition + Animal}.}

\item{faceted_by_2}{A string. Aditional grouping variables for visualization. Default to \code{.}.}
}
\value{
A new colum called \code{res_vs_fit_plot} containing ggplot objets with the residual plots of the model.
}
\description{
This functions take a nested df containing a model information including the column \code{augment} and return the residuals for a given model. Use this function chained with the \code{extract_model_info()}.
